Because the C# devs/Microsoft bigwigs are idiots, top level statements are enable by default, and it makes almost zero sense. If it is intended to attract more of a user base, I think it does the opposite, by making anyone who knows anything about C# lose interest. 

Combine that with implicit using statements enabled by default, and you get a stupid amount of setup to make your new projects resemble previous ones.


Making new console app projects:
Open a terminal in the directory you want to place a new project. Type the following command to create a new console project that resembles older .NET framework versions. The --framework and <netx.0> is not needed, only if you want to specify a specific version. (net6.0, net7.0, net8.0 ...)

dotnet new console --name <project name> --use-program-main --framework <netx.0>


Afterwards, you need to make sure that we turn off ImplicitUsings in the .csproj that is created:

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>       <------------  set this to disable!
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>


Then we have to actually paste the imports into our Program.cs (as these were implicitly imported before we turned that off)


using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

or type dotnet new console -h in the terminal to see help


Using the VSCode C# Dev kit extension doesn't let you create a new console app with the arguments we provided. 




Setting up debugger to run projects in vs code:

Open the project/solution in vscode so there is only one solution file. You can debug/run using the solution explorer from the file explorer tab.

If solution explorer isn't showing, try hitting CRTL+Shift+P and running Reset View Locations

Right click on the project/solution in the solution explorer and go to debug -> choose your verion.





While all of this does seem to work, it is making me lose interest in C# as a language, and lose faith in those developing it. I do think using Visual Studio seems to be the better option, as gross and clunky as it is.
